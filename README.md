# Mumbo Jumbo

<h3>
          Mumbo Jumbo is a collaborative writing game for stimulating creativity in language or writing classrooms. It
          is vaguely inspired by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_techniques">surrealist writing techniques</a>.

          <h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
          <br />
          <ul class="how_to_play">
            <li>⭐️The teacher hosts a game and generates a pin number.</li>
            <li>⭐️Participants join the game using the provided pin.</li>
            <li>⭐️Students start writing a story.</li>
            <li>⭐️The teacher shuffles the students stories.</li>
            <li>⭐️Each student receives another student's story and has to continue it.</li>
          </ul>
        </h3>
